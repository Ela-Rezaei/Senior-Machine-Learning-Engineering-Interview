If you have LeetCode Premium, start by focusing on the most recent questions from the company you are applying to, particularly those from the last three months. If you don’t have LeetCode Premium, you can use the below lists of selected questions available on LeetCode. Additionally, make sure to ask your recruiter if they can share any preparation materials. Recruiters often provide guidance on which algorithms or topics to focus on. For example, Meta has removed dynamic programming from their machine learning software engineering interviews recently (at the time I am writing this).

To practice coding questions effectively for interviews:

1- Start Without Timing Yourself: I started on paper using the above template. 

2- Gradually Move to Coding Environments: get comfortable with writing and debugging code in a real-world setting for example Coderpad.

3- Be Mindful of Time: Once you’re confident, start timing yourself. Solve each question within 20 minutes!
