If you have LeetCode Premium, start by focusing on the most recent questions from the company you are applying to, particularly those from the last three months. If you donâ€™t have LeetCode Premium, you can use curated lists of selected questions available on LeetCode. Additionally, make sure to ask your recruiter if they can share any preparation materials. Recruiters often provide guidance on which algorithms or topics to focus on. For example, Meta has removed dynamic programming from their machine learning software engineering interviews recently (at the time I am writing this).
