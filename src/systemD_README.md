## Chapter 4: ML System Design
For a Machine Learning role, you may not need deep expertise in general software engineering system design. However, as a senior engineer, itâ€™s important to understand the high-level components of typical software systems, the design choices available, and their trade-offs. In particular, understanding non-functional requirements and how different design choices impact them is crucial. As a senior engineer, you should be familiar with various system architecture options, their pros and cons, and how different components fit together to deliver a seamless user experience.
