# Senior Machine Learning Engineering Interview Guide
Welcome to this comprehensive guide designed to help you prepare for senior machine learning engineering interviews at FAANG and similar top-tier companies! ðŸš€

As a senior machine learning applied scientist, I recently went through the interview process after several years and found it to be overwhelming, unclear, and extremely time-intensive. The journey spans multiple stagesâ€”from the initial screening interview to onsite interviews, offer negotiations, and, in some cases, team matching processes (like at Meta). ðŸ¤¯

I struggled to gauge how much time it would take to master the vast amount of materialâ€”hundreds of LeetCode questions, algorithms and data structures, system design principles, and behavioral interview strategies tailored to my experience.

To cut through the ambiguity, I sifted through countless resourcesâ€”books, blogs, YouTube videos, and online coursesâ€”distilling them into a powerful, high-impact guide. ðŸ’»ðŸ“š This carefully curated collection is designed to equip you with the knowledge and strategies needed to excel in senior-level machine learning engineering roles (IC5+ in FAANG). I hope it proves as valuable to you as it was for me. ðŸ™Œ
