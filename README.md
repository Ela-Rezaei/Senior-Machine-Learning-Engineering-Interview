# Senior-Machine-Learning-Engineering-Interview
Welcome to this comprehensive guide designed to help you prepare for senior machine learning engineering interviews at FAANG and similar top-tier companies!

As a senior machine learning applied scientist, I recently went through the interview process after several years, and I found it to be overwhelming, unclear, and highly intricate. The journey spans multiple stagesâ€”from the initial screening interview to the onsite interviews, offer negotiations, and, in some cases, team matching processes (like at Meta). I was unsure how much time I needed to master all the required materials: hundreds of LeetCode questions, algorithms and data structures, system design concepts, and behavioral interviews tailored to my experience as a project lead engineer with several years in the field.

To navigate this complexity, I explored a wide range of resourcesâ€”books, blogs, YouTube videos, and online coursesâ€”and curated them into a concise, focused list. This guide compiles those resources to help you prepare effectively for senior-level machine learning engineering positions. I hope it proves as valuable to you as it was for me.

I would also like to express my gratitude to all the contributors and online resources that made this guide possible. Feedback and contributions are very welcome ðŸ˜Š. If you'd like to contribute, please make a pull request with your suggested changes. Letâ€™s dive in!
